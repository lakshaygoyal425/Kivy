Innovative user interfaces made easy.

Kivy is an open source, cross-platform [Python](https://www.python.org)
framework for the development of applications that make use of innovative,
multi-touch user interfaces.
The aim is to allow for quick and easy interaction design and rapid prototyping
whilst making your code reusable and deployable.

Kivy is written in Python and [Cython](http://cython.org/), based on OpenGL ES
2, supports various input devices and has an extensive widget library. With the
same codebase, you can target Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. All Kivy
widgets are built with multitouch support.
